# Presentations
This repository contains slides from my conference presentations, workshops, and talks.  It is currently a work in progress, and I have only populated it with a selection of presentations so far.

## Structure
- Each presentation is stored in a folder named `Year/ConferenceName/`.
- Folders include:
  - `slides.pdf`: PDF version of the slides.
  - `README.md`: Description of the presentation (e.g., conference name, date, and key points).
